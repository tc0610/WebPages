				<h2> Analysis of Themes in the Film</h1>

					One of the main themes in Kiki's Delivery Service is coming of age. Kiki's story demonstrates 
					that independence isn't such a simple dream to reach. After leaving her parent's house Kiki 
					had to face the challenge of not having a place to stay, finding an occupation to sustain herself, 
					and learning to live alone in a completely new environment with little friends and acquaintances. 
					One of her biggest struggles was trying to find and identify “who” she really was. She was troubled 
					by her unknown role in the society she was in.

					Having watched this film during different times of my life, my takeaways and thoughts 
					of this film have evolved as I am in different stages of my life. At age eleven 
					I was immensely impressed and inspired by Kiki's  journey in finding who she was as 
					she's learning to become independent. I admire her courage to leave home and start a 
					new life in a new place and it made me look forward to when it was my time to leave home and 
					find my own meaning and tempo in life. 
					
				</p>
				<p class="inter">
					At age twenty one I reminisce about that period of my life where independence and adulting had such a great impression on me. Thinking back, I 
					realized that eleven year old me romanticized the concept of adulthood and independence. 
					I overlooked the difficulties of survival and the challenges of being able to support my 
					independence and the life that I want. I didn't think ten years later I would have such a 
					difficult time figuring out who I am, what I want to do in life, what the meaning of my life is. 
					Ten years ago I wanted to be Kiki. Ten years later, I feel like Kiki and I am in the same boat as 
					her but I don't feel happy at all. I am worried and perplexed by who I am to become after college. 
					I thought college was going to tell me all the answers to life but I was wrong.
