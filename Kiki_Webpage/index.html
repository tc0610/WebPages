				<h3>The Creation Process of the Film</h3>

			<div id="grid6">
				<p id="create">
					Studio Ghibli acquired the rights to create a film adaptation of the novel Kiki's 
					Delivery Service by Eiko Kadono in 1987. The production task was initially given to 
					director Sunao Katabuchi and scriptwriter Nobuyuki Isshiki since Miyazaki was preoccupied 
					with the production of another film. However, Miyazaki was dissatisfied with Isshiki's 
					first draft and the original author was also not happy with the differences between the 
					screenplay and her novel. Hence, after making several changes to the project Miyazaki took 
					on the role of director and what was originally intended to be a 60-minute special turned 
					out to be a feature film under his hands. The film premiered on July 29, 1989 and was the 
					highest-grossing film in Japan in 1989.
